# Rust Book Exercises

This repository contains my attempt at performing practical exercises described
in the Rust Book.

The Rust version used to code, compile and run these exercises is:

```shell
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.50.0 (cb75ad5db 2021-02-10)
```

## Installation

`cd` into an exercise folder.

Use the package manager [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to install
dependencies for the exercise.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

`cd` into an exercise folder.

```bash
cargo run
```

## Contributing
